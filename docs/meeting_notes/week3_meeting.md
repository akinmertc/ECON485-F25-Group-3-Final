## üìù Discussion Summary

### 1. Project Overview & Assignment Review

**Topic:** Understanding Tourism Revenue & Visitor Trends Database

**Key Points Discussed:**
- Reviewed assignment document: tracking visitor numbers, hotel stays, and spending by region
- Identified primary goal: enable tourism board to make data-driven decisions
- Discussed real-world applications: seasonal planning, pricing strategies, infrastructure investment
- Examined KPIs: average spending per visitor, peak months, occupancy rates

**Economic Context Discussion:**
- Tourism is a major economic driver in many regions
- Seasonal patterns significantly impact employment and revenue
- Data analytics can inform policy decisions (infrastructure, marketing budgets)
- Hotels and regions compete for visitors - pricing and quality matter

**Questions Raised:**
- Q: Should we include international vs. domestic visitor distinction?
  - A: Yes, good idea for richer analysis
- Q: Do we need to track individual visitors or aggregate data?
  - A: Individual bookings, but can aggregate for reporting
- Q: What level of detail for expenditures (categories)?
  - A: At minimum: accommodation, food, activities, shopping

10. **Reviews** - Visitor feedback

### 6. AI Tool Exploration

**Tools Tested During Meeting:**

**Perplexity AI:**
- Researched: "tourism board database structure best practices"
- Researched: "seasonal tourism patterns analysis methods"
- Output: Confirmed our entity list aligns with industry standards
- Learned: Most systems track "length of stay" as key metric

**ChatGPT Initial Test:**
- Prompt: "What entities should a tourism revenue database include?"
- Response: Suggested regions, hotels, tourists, bookings, payments
- Team Review: Aligned with our brainstorm, validated our approach

**Documented in:** `/docs/ai_logs.md` (to be created Week 4)
