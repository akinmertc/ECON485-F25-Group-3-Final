## 📝 Discussion Summary

### 1. Project Overview & Assignment Review

**Topic:** Understanding Tourism Revenue & Visitor Trends Database

**Key Points Discussed:**
- Reviewed assignment document: tracking visitor numbers, hotel stays, and spending by region
- Identified primary goal: enable tourism board to make data-driven decisions
- Discussed real-world applications: seasonal planning, pricing strategies, infrastructure investment
- Examined KPIs: average spending per visitor, peak months, occupancy rates

**Economic Context Discussion:**
- Tourism is a major economic driver in many regions
- Seasonal patterns significantly impact employment and revenue
- Data analytics can inform policy decisions (infrastructure, marketing budgets)
- Hotels and regions compete for visitors - pricing and quality matter

**Questions Raised:**
- Q: Should we include international vs. domestic visitor distinction?
  - A: Yes, good idea for richer analysis
- Q: Do we need to track individual visitors or aggregate data?
  - A: Individual bookings, but can aggregate for reporting
- Q: What level of detail for expenditures (categories)?
  - A: At minimum: accommodation, food, activities, shopping

  ```
  /design, /data, /queries, /docs
  ```
- ✅ Initial README.md drafted
- ✅ All team members added as collaborators
- ✅ Instructor granted read access

**Git Workflow Agreed:**
- Main branch protected (requires pull request)
- Each member creates feature branches
- Commit messages must be descriptive
- Weekly merges during Monday meetings

### 5. Initial Project Scope Discussion

**Brainstorming Session - Entities Identified:**

**Core Entities (High Priority):**
1. **Regions** - Geographic areas (cities, provinces)
   - Attributes: RegionID, RegionName, Country, Type (urban/rural/coastal)
   
2. **Hotels** - Accommodation facilities
   - Attributes: HotelID, Name, StarRating, Address, RegionID, TotalRooms
   
3. **Visitors** - Tourist records
   - Attributes: VisitorID, Name, Country, Age, VisitorType (domestic/international)
   
4. **Bookings** - Reservation data
   - Attributes: BookingID, VisitorID, HotelID, CheckInDate, CheckOutDate, RoomType, PricePerNight
   
5. **Expenditures** - Spending records
   - Attributes: ExpenditureID, VisitorID, Category, Amount, Date, RegionID

**Supporting Entities (Medium Priority):**
6. **Seasons** - Temporal classification
   - Attributes: SeasonID, SeasonName (Peak/Shoulder/Off), StartMonth, EndMonth
   
7. **Room Types** - Hotel room categories
   - Attributes: RoomTypeID, TypeName (Standard/Deluxe/Suite), BasePrice, Capacity

**Optional Entities (Low Priority - if time permits):**
8. **Activities** - Tourist attractions/events
9. **Transportation** - Travel methods
10. **Reviews** - Visitor feedback

### 6. AI Tool Exploration

**Tools Tested During Meeting:**

**Perplexity AI:**
- Researched: "tourism board database structure best practices"
- Researched: "seasonal tourism patterns analysis methods"
- Output: Confirmed our entity list aligns with industry standards
- Learned: Most systems track "length of stay" as key metric

**ChatGPT Initial Test:**
- Prompt: "What entities should a tourism revenue database include?"
- Response: Suggested regions, hotels, tourists, bookings, payments
- Team Review: Aligned with our brainstorm, validated our approach

**Documented in:** `/docs/ai_logs.md` (to be created Week 4)

### 7. Week 4 Planning

**Deliverables Due Week 4:**
1. **1-Page Project Definition Document** (PDF)
   - Business problem statement
   - Entity list with descriptions
   - Initial use cases
   - Expected KPIs

2. **Initial ER Diagram** (using dbdiagram.io)
   - Core entities and relationships
   - Primary keys identified
   - Basic cardinalities (1:N, N:M)
