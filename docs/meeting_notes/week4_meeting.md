### 2. ER Diagram Design Review

**Presented by:** Mert Akin (Project Lead)

**Tool Used:** dbdiagram.io (as planned)

**Design Walkthrough:**

**Core Entities Confirmed:**
1. Regions (10 fields)
2. Hotels (11 fields)
3. Visitors (10 fields)
4. Bookings (11 fields)
5. Expenditures (8 fields)
6. Seasons (6 fields)
7. RoomTypes (4 fields)

**Relationships Validated:**
- Regions 1:N Hotels ✅
- Hotels 1:N Bookings ✅
- Visitors 1:N Bookings ✅
- Visitors 1:N Expenditures ✅
- Regions 1:N Expenditures ✅
- RoomTypes 1:N Bookings ✅

**Design Discussion Points:**

**Q: Should we add HotelRoomPricing table now or later?**
- Kaan Erdemir: "It would enable dynamic pricing by season"
- Mert Akin: "Adds complexity; maybe Week 5 refinement?"
- **Decision:** Add as optional entity in ER diagram with note "to be implemented if time permits in Stage 2"

**Q: How to handle Seasons relationship with Bookings?**
- Yaren Yamak: "Seasons aren't directly linked; they're derived from CheckInDate"
- Kaan Erdemir: "We could add SeasonID as FK in Bookings?"
- Mert Akin: "That creates redundancy; better to calculate in queries"
- **Decision:** Keep Seasons separate; use JOIN with date range matching in SQL queries

**Q: Do we need an Activities entity (tourist attractions)?**
- Oraz: "Could enrich analysis but adds scope"
- Yaren Yamak: "Let's focus on core entities first; Activities can be future enhancement"
- **Decision:** Document as "potential future enhancement" but not in initial schema

**Final ER Diagram Status:** ✅ Approved for submission

### 3. Normalization Pre-Check

**Led by:** Kaan Erdemir (Data Analyst)

**Objective:** Ensure we're on track for 3NF by Week 5

**Current Status:** 2NF with some 3NF compliance

**Normalization Issues Discussed:**

**Issue #1: TotalCost in Bookings table**
- **Problem:** TotalCost can be derived: PricePerNight × (CheckOutDate - CheckInDate)
- **3NF Violation?** Yes (derived attribute)
- **Discussion:**
  - Kaan Erdemir: "Keeping it improves query performance"
  - Yaren Yamak: "Creates update anomaly if PricePerNight changes"
  - Mert Akin: "In tourism, prices are immutable after booking"
- **Decision:** Keep TotalCost as denormalized field; document trade-off rationale
- **Rationale:** Performance benefit outweighs theoretical purity; no practical update risk

**Issue #2: Potential transitive dependencies**
- **Checked:** Bookings → HotelID → RegionID
- **Confirmed:** No RegionName stored in Bookings ✅
- **Checked:** Visitors → Country → (implied continent/region)
- **Confirmed:** No derived geographic data in Visitors ✅

**Week 5 Plan:**
1. Formal 3NF analysis document
2. Eliminate any remaining partial dependencies
3. Document all intentional denormalizations with justification

### 4. Sample Data Strategy

**Presented by:** Kaan Erdemir (Data Analyst)

**Data Generation Approach:**

**Option 1: Manual CSV creation**
- Pros: Full control, realistic data
- Cons: Time-consuming, limited volume

**Option 2: Python script (AI-assisted)**
- Pros: Large volume, reproducible, seasonal patterns
- Cons: May need refinement for realism

**Team Decision:** Hybrid approach
1. Use AI-generated Python script for bulk data (Kaan Erdemir to develop Week 5)
2. Manually curate 5-10 "featured" examples for demo purposes
3. Ensure data quality: No orphaned records, realistic distributions

**Data Volume Targets:**
- 10 Regions
- 50 Hotels (5 per region average)
- 1,000 Visitors
- 3,000 Bookings (over 24 months: 2024-2025)
- 10,000 Expenditures (multiple per visitor)
- 3 Seasons (Peak, Shoulder, Off)
- 5 Room Types (Standard, Deluxe, Suite, Family, Presidential)

**Seasonal Distribution:**
- Peak (Jun-Aug, Dec-Jan): 50% of bookings
- Shoulder (Apr-May, Sep-Oct): 30% of bookings
- Off (Feb-Mar, Nov): 20% of bookings

### 6. AI Tool Reflections

**Discussion Topic:** What worked well, what didn't?

**ChatGPT Feedback:**
- **Mert Akin:** "Very helpful for initial schema suggestions, but needed significant refinement"
- **Yaren Yamak:** "Excellent for KPI brainstorming and economic context"
- **Oraz:** "Generated good starting templates for documentation"

**Perplexity AI Feedback:**
- **Yaren Yamak:** "Better than ChatGPT for industry-specific research"
- **Kaan Erdemir:** "Provided sources, which helped verify accuracy"

**dbdiagram.io Feedback:**
- **Mert Akin:** "Syntax is intuitive, exports cleanly"
- **Kaan Erdemir:** "Wish it had better index visualization"

**Key Learning:**
- AI is excellent for **generating starting points**
- Human review is **essential** for domain accuracy
- **Testing** AI-generated code revealed important edge cases
- **Documentation** of AI interactions is time-consuming but valuable

**AI Usage Plan for Week 5:**
- Try SQLAI (HuggingFace) for text-to-SQL conversion
- Use GitHub Copilot for SQL boilerplate (if available to team)
- Continue logging all interactions

## 🤔 Questions / Concerns

**Q: Is our entity count (7 tables) sufficient?**
- **A:** Yes, course requires "multiple entities"; 7 is good coverage. Can add HotelRoomPricing later if needed.

**Q: Are we on schedule?**
- **A:** Yes, Stage 1 deliverables are complete. On track for Week 5 normalization.

**Q: Should we start thinking about queries now?**
- **A:** Yes, informally. Week 5 focus is schema, but Week 6 is CRUD operations, so reviewing query patterns helps validate schema design.

---

## 📅 Next Meeting

**Date:** Monday, Week 5  
**Time:** 4:00 PM  
**Agenda:**
- Review Stage 1 submission status
- Present normalization analysis
- Discuss SQL schema draft
- Begin planning CRUD operations for Week 6

## 💡 Key Insights

1. **AI Tools are Powerful but Require Oversight:** Every AI suggestion needed team validation
2. **Economic Context Drives Design:** Our KPI requirements shaped entity structure
3. **Normalization is a Judgment Call:** We made conscious trade-off (TotalCost denormalization)
4. **Documentation Takes Time:** AI logs and meeting notes are valuable but time-intensive
5. **Team Collaboration is Essential:** Different perspectives (data, econ, tech) strengthen design
